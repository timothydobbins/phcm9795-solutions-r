The following data present the weight loss (in grams) of the participants: 255 198 283 312 283 57 85 312 142 113 227 283 255 340 142 113 312 227 85 170 255 198 113 227 255 Enter these data into R. weightloss &lt;- c(255, 198, 283, 312, 283, 57, 85, 312, 142, 113, 227, 283, 255, 340, 142, 113, 312, 227, 85, 170, 255, 198, 113, 227, 255) What type of data are these? These are continuous numeric data. Construct an appropriate graph to display the relative frequency of participants’ weight loss. Your graph should start at 50 grams, with weight loss grouped into 50 gram bins. Provide appropriate labels for the axes and give the graph an appropriate title. # Check the default histogram: hist(weightloss) # The default values look ok, so let&#39;s add labels and titles hist(weightloss, xlab=&quot;Weight loss (g)&quot;, main=&quot;Weight loss for 25 participants&quot;) Note that the question requests relative frequencies, so we can use the code in Section 1.12 to amend this graph: h &lt;- hist(weightloss, plot=FALSE) h$density &lt;- h$counts/sum(h$counts)*100 plot(h, freq=FALSE, xlab=&quot;Weight loss (g)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Relative frequency (%)&quot;, main=&quot;Fig 1.1: Weight loss for 25 participants&quot;) Activity 1.2 Researchers at a maternity hospital in the 1970s conducted a study of low birth weight babies. Low birth weight is classified as a weight of 2,500g or less at birth. Data were collected on age and smoking status of mothers and the birth weight of their babies. The file Activity_S1.2.rds contains data on the participants in the study. The file is located on Moodle in the Learning Activities section. Use R to create a 2 by 2 table to show the proportions of low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and those that did not smoke during pregnancy. library(jmv) babies &lt;-readRDS(&quot;data/activities/Activity_S1.2.rds&quot;) # Examine the first six rows of data head(babies) ## AGE AgeGrp BWT LOW SMOKE ## 1 14 &lt;20 years 2466 Low birth weight Yes ## 2 14 &lt;20 years 2495 Low birth weight No ## 3 14 &lt;20 years 3941 Normal birth weight No ## 4 15 &lt;20 years 2353 Low birth weight No ## 5 15 &lt;20 years 2381 Low birth weight No ## 6 15 &lt;20 years 2778 Normal birth weight No # Create a two-way table showing row percents contTables(data=babies, rows=SMOKE, cols=LOW, pcRow=TRUE) ## ## CONTINGENCY TABLES ## ## Contingency Tables ## ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## SMOKE Low birth weight Normal birth weight Total ## ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Yes Observed 30 44 74 ## % within row 40.54054 59.45946 100.00000 ## ## No Observed 29 86 115 ## % within row 25.21739 74.78261 100.00000 ## ## Total Observed 59 130 189 ## % within row 31.21693 68.78307 100.00000 ## ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## ## ## χ² Tests ## ───────────────────────────────────── ## Value df p ## ───────────────────────────────────── ## χ² 4.923705 1 0.0264906 ## N 189 ## ───────────────────────────────────── Answer the following questions: What was the total number of mothers who smoked during pregnancy? There were 74 mothers who smoked during pregancy. What proportion of mothers who smoked gave birth to low birth weight babies? What proportion of non-smoking mothers gave birth to low birth weight babies? 41% of mothers who smoked and 25% of non-smoking mothers gave birth to low birth weight babies. Use R to construct a stacked bar chart of the data to examine if there a difference in the proportion of babies born with a low birth weight in relation to mother’s age? Provide appropriate labels for the axes and give the graph an appropriate title. We follow the instructions for creating a stacked bar chart in Module 1. First we create a table of low birth weight by mothers’ age-group, and create a stacked bar chart (to check that we’re on the right track): counts &lt;- table(babies$LOW, babies$AgeGrp) counts ## ## &lt;20 years 20-24 years 25-29 years 30-34 years ## Low birth weight 15 25 15 4 ## Normal birth weight 36 44 27 18 ## ## 35 or more years ## Low birth weight 0 ## Normal birth weight 5 barplot(counts, main=&quot;Fig 1.2: Frequency of low birth weight by mother&#39;s age group&quot;, legend = rownames(counts), beside=FALSE) We then calculate the relative frequency of low-birth weight by mothers’ age group percent &lt;- prop.table(counts, margin=2)*100 percent ## ## &lt;20 years 20-24 years 25-29 years 30-34 years ## Low birth weight 29.41176 36.23188 35.71429 18.18182 ## Normal birth weight 70.58824 63.76812 64.28571 81.81818 ## ## 35 or more years ## Low birth weight 0.00000 ## Normal birth weight 100.00000 and use the barplot() command, as per the notes: barplot(percent, main=&quot;Fig 1.3: Relative frequency of low birth weight by mother&#39;s age group&quot;, legend = rownames(percent), beside=FALSE) Using your answers to the question a) and b), write a brief conclusion about the relationship of low birth weight and mother’s age and smoking status. In the study, the greatest number of babies were born to mothers in the 20-24 years age group, with the number of babies born declining with increasing maternal age for mothers older than 20-24 years (Figure 1.2). A larger proportion of mothers in the &lt;20 years, 20-24 years and 25-29 years age groups gave birth to low birth weight babies compared to mothers aged 30-34 years. No low birth weight babies were born to mothers aged 35 or more (Figure 1.3). A larger proportion of mothers who smoked during pregnancy gave birth to low birth weight babies compared to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. NB: You will revisit two-way tables in Module 7 where you will conduct statistical tests to determine if the proportions are statistically different to each other. Note: Coding graphs, particularly clustered and stacked bar graphs can be difficult! The site https://r-graph-gallery.com/ gives excellent instructions on constructing different types of graphs in R. Activity 1.3 Using R, estimate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range and interquartile range for the data Activity_S1.3.rds, available on Moodle. act1_3 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/activities/Activity_S1.3.rds&quot;) descriptives(act1_3, mode=TRUE, iqr=TRUE, pc=TRUE) ## ## DESCRIPTIVES ## ## Descriptives ## ──────────────────────────────────── ## Lead_concn ## ──────────────────────────────────── ## N 15 ## Missing 0 ## Mean 1.500000 ## Median 1.500000 ## Mode 1.900000 ## Standard deviation 0.8434623 ## IQR 1.0000000 ## Minimum 0.1000000 ## Maximum 3.200000 ## 25th percentile 0.9500000 ## 50th percentile 1.500000 ## 75th percentile 1.950000 ## ──────────────────────────────────── We can use the descriptives() function to obtain summary statistics. Examining the help entry for descriptives() shows we can request the mode using mode=TRUE, the interquartile range using iqr=TRUE and the percentiles (by default, the quartiles) using pc=TRUE. The mean is estimated as 1.50, the median is 1.5 and the mode is 1.9. The standard deviation is estimated as 0.843, the range is from 0.1 to 3.2, and the inter-quartile range is from 1.0 to 2.0 (both rounded to 1 decimal place). Note: no units were provided for the data used in this question. Summary statistics must be presented with their units where the units are available. Activity 1.4 Data of diastolic blood pressure (BP) of a sample of study participants are provided in the dataset Activity_S1.4.rds. Compute the mean, median, range and SD of diastolic BP. act1_4 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/activities/Activity_S1.4.rds&quot;) descriptives(act1_4) ## ## DESCRIPTIVES ## ## Descriptives ## ────────────────────────────────── ## diabp ## ────────────────────────────────── ## N 100 ## Missing 0 ## Mean 82.23000 ## Median 83.00000 ## Standard deviation 13.01522 ## Minimum 56.00000 ## Maximum 118.0000 ## ────────────────────────────────── The mean is 82.2 mmHg and the median is 83.0 mmHg. The range is 56.0 to 118.0 mmHg (62.0 mmHg) and the standard deviation is 13.02 mmHg. Note that the original data have one decimal place, so we can report the median with one decimal place. Although we are justified in presenting the mean to two decimal places (1 extra than the original data), and the standard deviation with three decimal places (1 more than the mean), there is little to be gained in this level of precision when presenting summary statistics for blood pressure. Activity 1.5 In a study of 100 participants data were missing for 5 people. The missing data points were coded as ‘99’. The mean of the data was estimated as 45.0 with a standard deviation of 5.6; the smallest and greatest values are 16 and 65 respectively. If the researcher analysed the data as if the 99s were real data, would it make the following statistics larger, smaller, or stay the same? Mean The mean will be larger. Standard Deviation The standard deviation will be larger. Range The range will be larger. The smallest value is still 16, but the largest is 99, and so the range is 99 − 16 = 83. Activity 1.6 Which of the following statements are true? The more dispersed, or spread out, a set of observations are: The smaller the mean value This is not true because the mean is not influenced by the spread of the values (if the distribution is symmetrical around the mean value) The larger the standard deviation This is true. The larger the spread, the larger the deviations from the mean. Hence the standard deviation will be larger. The smaller the variance This is not true. The variance will be larger if the deviations from the mean are larger. Activity 1.7 If the variance for a set of scores is equal to 9, what is the standard deviation? SD = \\(\\sqrt{variance} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\).

Assume that the two drugs are equally preferred, that is, the probability that a patient prefers either of the drugs is equal (50%). Use one of the binomial functions in R to compute the probability that 60 or more patients would prefer the new drug. In completing this question, determine: The number of trials (n) Here, each participant represents a ‘trial’, so n is 90. The number of successes we are interested in (k) We are interested in determining the probability that 60 or more participants prefer the new drug, so k is 60. The probability of success for each trial (p) We are told to assume that the two drugs are equally preferred, so p is 0.5. The form of the R function: dbinom or pbinom We need to calculate the probability that 60 or more participants prefer the new drug. The two R functions can be interpreted as follows: - the dbinom function gives the probability of observing 60 successes; - the pbinom function gives the probability of observing 60 or fewer successes; - the pbinom function with lower.tail=FALSE gives the probability of observing more than 60 successes. We therefore want to use pbinom function with lower.tail=FALSE here. The final probability. To calculate the probability of obtaining 60 or more successes, we need to calculate the probabibility of observing more than 59 successes. So the function we use is: pbinom(q=59, size=90, prob=0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) ## [1] 0.001030133 Therefore, the probability that 60 or more patients would prefer the new drug is 0.001 or 0.1%. Activity 2.2 A case of Schistosomiasis is identified by the detection of schistosome ova in a faecal sample. In patients with a low level of infection, a field technique of faecal examination has a probability of 0.35 of detecting ova in any one faecal sample. If five samples are routinely examined for each patient, use R to compute the probability that a patient with a low level of infection: Will not be identified? In all of these questions, size is 5 and prob is 0.35. Here we need to calculate the probability of P(X=0), and we can use the dbinom function: dbinom(x=0, size=5, prob=0.35) ## [1] 0.1160291 The probability P(X=0) = 0.116 or 11.6%. Will be identified in two of the samples? The probability P(X=2)= 0. 336 or 33.6%: dbinom(x=2, size=5, prob=0.35) ## [1] 0.3364156 Will be identified in all the samples? The probability P(X=5) = .005 or 0.5%: dbinom(x=5, size=5, prob=0.35) ## [1] 0.005252187 Will be identified in at most 3 of the samples? “At most 3 samples” is the same as 3 or fewer samples, so we can use the pbinom function. The probability P(X≤3) = .946 or 94.6%: pbinom(q=3, size=5, prob=0.35) ## [1] 0.9459775 Activity 2.3 If weights of men are Normally distributed with a population mean \\(\\mu\\) = 87, and a population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\) = 8 kg: What is the probability that a man will weigh 95 kg or more? Draw a Normal curve of the area represented by this probability in the population (i.e. with \\(\\mu\\) = 87 kg and \\(\\sigma\\) = 8 kg). The curve representing the desired probability is drawn below, with the region above 95kg shaded to represent the probability of interest. Note that this curve was generated by a computer: a hand-drawn figure is completely acceptable. A hand-drawn figure will probably look much less tidy, but the main thing to notice is that the shaded area looks like it would represent less than 50% of the total curve. Therefore, our final probability should be less than 0.5. Figure 1: Probability that a man will weigh 95kg or more The probability is calculated as: # Probability: pnorm(95, mean=87, sd=8, lower.tail=FALSE) ## [1] 0.1586553 Therefore, the probability that a man from this population weighs 95 kg or more is 0.16 or 16%. What is the probability that a man will weigh more than 75 kg but less than 95 kg? Draw the area represented by this probability on a standardised Normal curve. The curve to represent this probability is shown below. To obtain the probability represented by the shaded region, we again use the fact that the total area under a Normal curve must add to 1. Let’s break the curve into three parts, which we will call A, B and C. We use that fact that A+B+C=1 to derive that B = 1– A – C. We have already calculated C in Part (a) of this question. To calculate A: pnorm(75, mean=87, sd=8, lower.tail=TRUE) ## [1] 0.0668072 P(Weight &lt; 75) = 0.0668. The region B is calculated as: 1 - 0.1587 - 0.0668 = 0.7745. So the probability that a man will weigh more than 75 kg but less than 95 kg is 0.77, or 77%. Activity 2.4 Using the health survey data described in the R notes of this module, create a new variable, BMI, which is equal to a person’s weight (in kg) divided by their height (in metres) squared (i.e. \\(\\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{\\text{[height (m)]}^2}\\). Categorise BMI using the WHO categories provided in the R notes. Create a two-way table to display the distribution of BMI categories by sex (sex: 1 = respondent identifies as male; 2 = respondent identifies as female). Does there appear to be a difference in categorised BMI between males and females? library(readxl) library(jmv) survey &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/examples/health-survey.xlsx&quot;) summary(survey) ## sex height weight ## Min. :1.00 Min. :1.220 Min. : 22.70 ## 1st Qu.:1.00 1st Qu.:1.630 1st Qu.: 68.00 ## Median :2.00 Median :1.700 Median : 79.40 ## Mean :1.55 Mean :1.698 Mean : 81.19 ## 3rd Qu.:2.00 3rd Qu.:1.780 3rd Qu.: 90.70 ## Max. :2.00 Max. :2.010 Max. :213.20 After reading in the data, we define sex as a factor, and create BMI: survey$sex &lt;- factor(survey$sex, level=c(1,2), labels=c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;)) survey$bmi = survey$weight / (survey$height^2) After creating BMI, we should examine its distribution using a histogram and/or a boxplot: hist(survey$bmi, main=&quot;Histogram of BMI&quot;, xlab=&quot;Body mass index (kg/m2)&quot;) boxplot(survey$bmi, main=&quot;Boxplot of BMI&quot;, ylab=&quot;Body mass index (kg/m2)&quot;) The boxplot in particular shows that there are some extreme values of BMI. We can examine these records by viewing records with BMI less than, say 15, or greater than 45: subset(survey, bmi&lt;15) ## # A tibble: 2 × 4 ## sex height weight bmi ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 1.57 22.7 9.21 ## 2 Female 1.65 40.8 15.0 subset(survey, bmi&gt;45) ## # A tibble: 16 × 4 ## sex height weight bmi ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 1.52 105 45.4 ## 2 Male 1.85 174. 50.8 ## 3 Female 1.22 74.8 50.3 ## 4 Male 1.93 213. 57.2 ## 5 Female 1.63 127 47.8 ## 6 Female 1.55 115. 48.0 ## 7 Female 1.65 131. 48.2 ## 8 Female 1.55 109. 45.3 ## 9 Male 1.78 143. 45.1 ## 10 Female 1.65 127 46.6 ## 11 Female 1.63 132. 49.5 ## 12 Female 1.7 152 52.6 ## 13 Female 1.6 127 49.6 ## 14 Female 1.5 106. 47.2 ## 15 Female 1.73 154. 51.5 ## 16 Female 1.6 116. 45.4 The smallest BMI of 9.2 kg/m2 is very low, with a weight of 22.7 kg. We should check the recorded height and weight values against the original data (paper records, survey responses) if they were available. However, as a weight of 22.7kg is not impossible, this record will not be deleted. An alternative approach would be to analyse the data including the very low BMI and again excluding the very low BMI as a sensitivity analysis. The largest BMI values are based on participants with large weights, and none of these seem biologically implausible. Therefore, no changes will be made to participants with small or large values of BMI. We can use the cut() function to create the BMI categories. The WHO cutpoints are inclusive of the lower-bound, so we use right=FALSE. After creating the categories, it is good practice to check the resulting categories using summary(): survey$bmi_cat &lt;- cut(survey$bmi, c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, 35, 40, 100), right=FALSE) summary(survey$bmi_cat) ## [0,18.5) [18.5,25) [25,30) [30,35) [35,40) [40,100) ## 18 362 411 201 101 47 Finally, we can create a two-way table using the contTables() function within the jmv package. We can define the rows by BMI category, and the columns by sex: contTables(data=survey, rows = bmi_cat, cols = sex) ## ## CONTINGENCY TABLES ## ## Contingency Tables ## ──────────────────────────────────────── ## bmi_cat Male Female Total ## ──────────────────────────────────────── ## [0,18.5) 6 12 18 ## [18.5,25) 134 228 362 ## [25,30) 216 195 411 ## [30,35) 95 106 201 ## [35,40) 46 55 101 ## [40,100) 16 31 47 ## Total 513 627 1140 ## ──────────────────────────────────────── ## ## ## χ² Tests ## ───────────────────────────────────── ## Value df p ## ───────────────────────────────────── ## χ² 22.49802 5 0.0004209 ## N 1140 ## ───────────────────────────────────── To assess whether there is a difference in BMI between males and females, we should look at the within-sex relative frequencies.

Activity 2.5 The data in the file Activity_S2.5.rds (available on Moodle) has information about birth weight and length of stay collected from 117 babies admitted consecutively to a hospital for surgery.

As birthweight follows a roughly symmetric distribution, we should present the mean and standard deviation as the appropriate measures of central tendency and spread. Notice that the mean and median are similar, which is to be expected for a symmetric distribution. Length of stay is highly skewed. In this case, the median and interquartile range are the appropriate measures to present. Notice that the mean is higher than the median, which is typical for distributions that are skewed to the right.

After devising a method which enables her to determine the weekly consumption of sweets by a child, she conducted a pilot survey and found that the standard deviation of sweet consumption by the children per week is 85 gm (assuming this is the σ). She considers taking a random sample for the main survey of: 25 children, or 100 children, or 625 children or 3,000 children.

What happens to the standard error as the sample size increases? What can you say about the precision of the sample mean as the sample size increases? When the sample size increases, the standard error of the mean (and hence the maximum likely error) decreases. Thus, sample means from larger samples are more precise than from smaller samples.

P &gt; 0.05 There is weak or little evidence against the null hypothesis - but the researchers should be advised to provide the actual P-value, not just P &gt; 0.05. ‘ns’ indicating not significant Traditionally, ‘ns’ stands for not significant (for the set level of significance mentioned in the study, usually 0.05). You might still come across this term in some journal articles but this is not best practice for most journals these days. Researchers should always state the P-value (not just whether or not it was significant). significant differences exist This would imply that the P-value is less than the set level of significance mentioned in the study (usually, 0.05). As such, we would conclude that there was evidence against the null hypothesis. However, the researchers should be advised to always state the P-value (not just whether or not it was significant). Activity 4.2 For the following hypothetical situations, formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis and write a conclusion about the study results: A study was conducted to investigate whether the mean systolic blood pressure of males aged 40 to 60 years was different to the mean systolic blood pressure of females aged 40 to 60 years. The result of the study was that the mean systolic blood pressure was higher in males by 5.1 mmHg (95% CI 2.4 to 7.6; P = 0.008). H0: There is no difference in the mean systolic blood pressure between males aged 40-60 years and females aged 40-60 years. HA: There is a difference in the mean systolic blood pressure between males aged 40-60 years and females aged 40 to 60 years. Conclusion: The mean SBP was 5.1 mmHg (95% CI: 2.4 to 7.6 mmHg) higher in males aged 40-60 years compared to females aged 40-60 years. The P value is 0.008 which provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a difference in the mean SBP of males and females aged 40-60 years. A case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between obesity and breast cancer. The researchers found an OR of 3.21 (95% CI 1.15 to 8.47; P = 0.03). H0: There is no association between obesity and breast cancer. [A more formal way of saying this is that there is no difference in the odds of exposure to obesity among cases of breast cancer and controls i.e. OR = 1]. HA: There is an association between obesity and breast cancer. [A more formal way of saying this is that there is a difference in the odds of exposure to obesity among cases and controls i.e. OR ≠ 1]. Conclusion: The odds ratio is estimated as 3.21, indicating a positive association between the study factor of obesity and the outcome of breast cancer. The 95% CI is 1.15 to 8.47 and excludes the null value of no association (i.e. OR = 1). The P value is 0.03 which provides evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a positive association between obesity and breast cancer. A cohort study investigated the relationship between eating a healthy diet and the incidence of influenza infection among adults aged 20 to 60 years. The results were RR = 0.88 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.50; P = 0.2). H0: There is no association between influenza infection and a healthy diet among adults aged 20-60 years. [A more formal way of saying this is that there is no difference in the risk of influenza infection among adults aged 20-60 years who have a healthy diet compared to those who do not have a healthy diet. i.e. RR = 1]. HA: There is an association between influenza infection and a healthy diet among adults aged 20-60 years. [A more formal way of saying this is that there is a difference in the risk of influenza infection among adults aged 20-60 years who have a healthy diet compared to those who do not have a healthy diet. i.e. RR ≠ 1]. Conclusion: The relative risk is estimated as 0.88, indicating a protective association between the study factor of healthy diet and the outcome factor of influenza infection among adults aged 20 to 60 years. However, the 95% confidence interval includes the null value of 1.0 (no association). The P value is 0.2, which means there is no evidence against the null hypothesis. Thus, we can conclude that there is no evidence of an association between a healthy diet and influenza infection among adults aged 20 to 60 years. Activity 4.3 A pilot study was conducted to compare the mean daily energy intake of women aged 25 to 30 years with the recommended intake of 7750 kJ/day.

There is evidence (t = −2.71 with 11 DF, P = 0.02) that the mean daily energy intake of women aged 25-30 years is lower than the recommended daily intake of 7750 kJ/day. Activity 4.4 Which procedure gives the researcher the better chance of rejecting a null hypothesis? comparing the data-based p-value with the level of significance at 5% comparing the 95% CI with a nominated value neither procedure Both ‘a’ and ‘b’ would give the same chance to reject the null hypothesis. This is because both ‘a’ and ‘b’ are giving you the same information in a different way. In ‘a’ you will get the probability of observing the difference you see in your data by chance and if it is &lt;0.05 you will reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level. Whereas in ‘b’ you will see whether the null value (value of no difference) lies within the range which you are 95% confident contains the true value. If the null value falls outside the 95% CI, you would have less than 5% (100-95 = 5%) probability seeing the observed difference in your data if there were no difference. Activity 4.5 Setting the significance level at P &lt; 0.10 instead of the more usual P &lt; 0.05 increases the likelihood of: a Type I error a Type II error rejecting the null hypothesis Not rejecting the null hypothesis Setting the significance level cut-off at 0.10 instead of the more usual 0.05 increases the likelihood of a. a Type I error and c. rejecting the null hypothesis. The cut-off of 0.10 increases the chance of a type I error from 5% to 10% (the chance of making a Type I error is the same as the significance level). If the significance level is higher, then there higher probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if there no effect in reality. Activity 4.6 For a fixed sample size setting the significance level at a very extreme cut-off such as P &lt; 0.001 increases the chances of: obtaining a significant result rejecting the null hypothesis a Type I error a Type II error Setting the significance level at a very extreme cut-off (such as 0.001) increases the chances of: d. a Type II error. For a given sample, if the significance level is set very small it will make it harder to find evidence against the null hypothesis. In other words, it will be difficult to detect an effect if an effect exists in reality. In other words, the probability of type II error will increase: you will not be able to reject the null hypothesis when a real difference exists.
